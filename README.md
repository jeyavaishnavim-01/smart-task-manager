##Key Features
**Glassmorphism UI**: Modern "frosted glass" aesthetic with smooth hover effects.
**Dark Mode**: Eye-friendly theme toggle for late-night productivity.
**Persistence**: Tasks are saved to `localStorage`, so they won't disappear on refresh.
**Categorization**: Organize tasks into Work, Personal, or Urgent buckets.
**Responsive**: Optimized for both Desktop (large screen) and Mobile views.

##Tech Stack
**HTML5**: Semantic structure.
**CSS3**: Custom variables, Flexbox, and Grid.

**Lucide Icons**: Premium vector iconography.

##What I Learned
This project helped me master the **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) cycle and understand how to manage state in vanilla JavaScript without using heavy frameworks.
